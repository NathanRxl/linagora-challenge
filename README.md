### Dev notes

As you can see in the .gitignore file:
* The data files are assumed to be in a **data/** folder, at the root directory
* The jupyter notebooks are assumed to be in a **notebooks/** folder, at the root directory
* The submission files are assumed to be in a **submissions/** folder, at the root directory
* The references of the project (research articles, blog articles, ...) are assumed to live in a **references/** folder, at the root directory

### Reminder of the general objective

Being first on the public leaderboard as soon as possible when we are not, without overfitting nor the training neither the public test sets.
Each development and analysis must be led by this first pragmatic objective.
